## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms is a fundamental course for computer science students that teaches them how to organize and manipulate data efficiently and effectively. It is a critical area of study because it provides students with the skills and knowledge necessary to design, analyze, and optimize algorithms for solving real-world problems.

The course introduces students to various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and how to implement algorithms that operate on these data structures. Students will also learn about algorithm analysis and complexity theory, which are essential for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms.

The lab component of the course allows students to apply the theoretical concepts they learn in the classroom to practical problems. In the lab, students will work on programming assignments that involve implementing various data structures and algorithms. They will also learn how to analyze the performance of their implementations using tools like Big-O notation.

The study of Data Structures and Algorithms is crucial in many areas of computer science, including computer graphics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptography, database systems, and networking. By studying this course, students will develop problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and analytical thinking, which are valuable in various areas of computer science and beyond.

The project work for this course will provide students with an opportunity to design and implement an algorithm for solving a real-world problem. This project will help students to apply the concepts learned in class to a practical scenario and gain a deeper understanding of the course material. Moreover, this project work will enable students to develop programming skills, improve their ability to work in teams, and enhance their communication and presentation skills.

In conclusion, Data Structures and Algorithms is an essential course for computer science students. It provides students with the skills and knowledge necessary to solve real-world problems efficiently and effectively. The lab and project work for this course offer students the opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts learned in class to practical scenarios and gain a deeper understanding of the course material.


## Problem Statement

Due to the lack of medicines at local pharmacies/dispensaries in rural areas, people are required to travel long distances in order to obtain them. This is a challenging situation that deprives people in rural areas of access to necessary medical care and puts a strain on their resources. Travelling long distances to acquire medicines can be expensive and time-consuming, and can even be dangerous in some locations. This highlights the need for improved access to medical supplies in rural areas.

## Learning and Takeaway

Efficient algorithms are crucial for the smooth functioning of programs that deal with large datasets or complex computations. The choice of data structures and algorithms should be carefully considered depending on the task at hand and the nature of the data. Testing and validation of functions are critical to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the program. Regular code maintenance and updates can improve the program's performance and keep it up to date with the latest technologies and best practices and Team Work.
